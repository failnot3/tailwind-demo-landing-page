# tailwind-demo-landing-page
A Tailwind exercise.

## In this exercise
I've build an landing page with the help of Tailwind magic. 

## What's Tailwind?
>Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files,
>JavaScript components, and any other templates for class names,
>generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.

>It's fast, flexible, and reliable â€” with zero-runtime.
